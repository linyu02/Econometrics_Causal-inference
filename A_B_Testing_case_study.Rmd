A/B Testing Case Study: Marketing Campaign Effectiveness

```{r}
# Load data
data("PlantGrowth")
head(PlantGrowth)
```
```{r}
# Subset Control vs Treatment 1
subset_data <- subset(PlantGrowth, group %in% c("ctrl", "trt1"))

# A/B test (two-sample t-test)
t_test_result <- t.test(weight ~ group, data = subset_data)
t_test_result

```
The test suggests no statistically significant difference between the current marketing campaign (Control) and the new campaign (Treatment 1). The observed decrease of 0.37 units in average outcome is within the range of random variation.

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Subset Control vs Treatment 1
subset_data <- subset(PlantGrowth, group %in% c("ctrl", "trt1"))

# Boxplot with jittered points
ggplot(subset_data, aes(x = group, y = weight, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.6, outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "A/B Test: Control vs Treatment 1",
    x = "Group (Marketing Campaign)",
    y = "Outcome (Sales Proxy)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
